# Tasks and Datasets

## Spectrum Segmentation 
This task focuses on segmenting the radio frequency spectrum to identify different signals, namely 5G New
Radio (NR), LTE and noise signals. Accurate segmentation is crucial for efficient spectrum management and interference mitigation. For this end, we use a dataset created by generating NR and LTE signals, each transmitted through its respective wireless channel in in neighboring frequency bands.

## CSI Sensing 
In this task, participants will analyze Channel State Information (CSI) to detect human activity in an indoor environment. Particularly, the CSI information are being used to sense and interpret six different human activities: running, walking, falling, boxing, arm circling, and floor clearning. Each subject performs these activities between a pair of Wi-Fi access points, each equipped with three antennas.
