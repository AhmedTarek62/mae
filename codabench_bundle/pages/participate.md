# How to participate

Participants can tackle the following five tasks:

1. Spectrum Segmentation
2. CSI Sensing
3. Signal Identification
4. Channel Estimation
5. Positioning

Detailed descriptions of these tasks and their respective datasets can be found in the Tasks & Datasets tab.

## Submission Requirements

For each task, participants are required to submit the following:

1. `model.py`: A Python file containing the developed model architecture. This architecture must incorporate the pre-trained SRFM encoder as its core component.

2. `checkpoint.pth`: A checkpoint file containing the trained model parameters.
By submitting these files, participants ensure that their solutions can be evaluated consistently and effectively.

## Key Notes
* Each task is evaluated independently. Participants can choose to work on one or more tasks based on their expertise and interests.
* The pre-trained SRFM encoder must be used as the foundation for the submitted models.
