# Overview
The **Specialized Radio Foundation Model (SRFM) Fine-tuning** Challenge invites participants to explore and innovate using the SRFM, a cutting-edge foundation model for radio tasks, as detailed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09996).

The goal of this challenge is to fine-tune the SRFM for various radio applications, pushing the boundaries of machine learning in the wireless communication domain. Participants will tackle diverse tasks such as *signal classification*, *channel estimation*, or *channel state information sensing*, demonstrating the model's adaptability and performance improvements in specialized scenarios.

This challenge not only provides an opportunity to engage with a state-of-the-art model but also contributes to advancing wireless communication technologies, paving the way for robust and efficient AI-driven radio systems.
